%QY calculations based on Ozin et al. 2012, DOI : 10.1002/lpor.201200077
%APPROX: QY independent of excitation wavelength
%Buy solid standards! Small Cie Ã  retrouver, but check if NIST & friends have anything or even better, methods to recommand
%Download standard data from PhotochemCAD
%FOR METHO: Do not forget to correct by background substraction, prolly better to record it inpendently to not forget it, along with empty sphere measure, and correct in post-processing here
%FOR METHO: dispersion calibration with spectral lamp
%FOR METHO: Always make very sure the excitation peak is always clearly below the max, here 4000, and/or zoom in live to check
%...TO CHECK : correction for sampling converted in energy & compensating for detector non linearity increasing with higher signal might held 
%N.B. I wonder for metho if a (powerful enough) LED's or lamp broad spectrum (can put a filter or grating to select a narrower band) might not make easier to measure a small absorption especially when very high QY or big absorption (inner filter!) for small QY, thus can use very diluted samples... but might need to include dispersion/spectral response of input optics
%N.B. Examine overlap of excitation & emission, prolongation vs just cut in half & check vs sum. Play in laser vs LED argument.
%N.B. Should add frequency cut off for fast noise... vs smoothing, check effect vs signal/noise, WARNING : MUST NOT AFFECT LASER PEAK!!!
%N.B. Could absolute y-scale choice affect numerical error propagation?
%N.B. Possibility to apply correction for the reabsorption-inner filter effect, but I am dubious: <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103878>,somewhere in there <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp2082853> and this thesis <https://ecommons.usask.ca/handle/10388/ETD-2012-11-765>, etc. This one is more convincing: <>
%N.B. Talk radiometry & photometry w/ Pierre and where to find relevant litterature, standards, etc.

%VARIABLES

%Spectra to be imported as the following vectors
% ilambda : Wavelength of all spectra
% iaEmpty : The excitation source incident inside the empty sphere
% ibnotBeam : The sample inside the sphere, but not directly in the path of the excitation/incident beam.
% icBeam : The sample inside the sphere and directly in the incident/exciting beam path.
% iCCD : CCD detector sensitivity response (to replace with IRF_spectral instrument response function_ including sphere in calibration with a soleil)
%if needed, scaling to same acquisition time (keep same units for all, here usec)

tPL_b=10000000;

%PreProcessing: patching data together first and removing baseline (-data...), urg should be done in lab with dark spectrum. Here choice of letting negative contribute to the integral or not
%CHECK: Demonstrate in QY math that all scaling/patching (assuming linear) by acquisition time does not affect result.

%Checking absorbance for reabsorption problems ("inner filter effect" though check how it depends on overlap between abs & PL spectra), should stay roughly below 0.1
%N.B. competes with having a "good" (vs noise?) absorption signal

[LaserMax_c,LaserLambda_c]=max(cBeam.*t_a./tEx_c)

%Plot checks, also used to find integration index, though that should be done after the scaling below.
